## Project Structure

SA2DGE is organized into modular components.

The exact structure may evolve as the engine develops, but contributors should generally keep responsibilities separated.

For example:

```text
SA2DGE/
├── src/
│   ├── core/
│   ├── graphics/
│   ├── input/
│   ├── physics/
│   ├── audio/
│   └── ...
│
├── examples/
├── tests/
├── docs/
├── assets/
├── README.md
└── CONTRIBUTING.md
```

### General Principles

- Keep engine systems modular.
- Avoid unnecessary coupling between subsystems.
- Prefer clear interfaces between components.
- Avoid introducing dependencies without a strong reason.
- Keep platform-specific functionality isolated where possible.
- Do not mix unrelated changes in the same Pull Request.

---

## Development Workflow

SA2DGE follows a simple contribution workflow:

```text
Issue / Idea
     ↓
Discussion
     ↓
Implementation
     ↓
Testing
     ↓
Pull Request
     ↓
Review
     ↓
Merge
```

For larger features, contributors should first describe:

- What problem the feature solves.
- Why the feature belongs in the engine.
- Proposed API or architecture.
- Potential performance implications.
- Compatibility considerations.
- Testing strategy.

---

## Making Changes

When implementing a feature or fixing a bug, try to keep the change as small and focused as possible.

### Good

```text
Add collision filtering to physics system
```

### Avoid

```text
Add collision filtering + rewrite renderer + rename engine classes + update documentation
```

Unrelated changes make code review harder and increase the chance of introducing regressions.

---

## Engine Architecture Guidelines

When contributing to SA2DGE, keep the following principles in mind.

### Modularity

Each subsystem should have a clear responsibility.

For example:

```text
Renderer → Rendering
Input    → Input handling
Physics  → Collision and simulation
Audio    → Sound and music
Scene    → Game-world organization
Core     → Engine lifecycle and shared infrastructure
```

Avoid placing unrelated functionality inside a single system.

### Performance

SA2DGE is a game engine, so performance matters.

Consider:

- Avoiding unnecessary allocations in hot loops.
- Reducing redundant rendering operations.
- Avoiding unnecessary updates.
- Reusing resources where appropriate.
- Measuring performance before introducing complex optimizations.

Do not sacrifice readability for a micro-optimization without evidence that the optimization is necessary.

### API Design

Public engine APIs should be:

- Predictable.
- Consistent.
- Easy to understand.
- Minimal where possible.
- Stable unless a breaking change is intentional.

Before introducing a new public API, consider whether an existing abstraction can be extended instead.

---

## Code Style

Follow the existing coding style of the project.

General guidelines:

- Use meaningful names.
- Keep functions focused.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Prefer readable code over clever code.
- Document non-obvious behavior.
- Remove unused code and imports.
- Avoid unnecessary comments that simply restate the code.

### Example

Prefer:

```text
calculateCollisionResponse()
```

over:

```text
calcCR()
```

Names should communicate intent.

---

## Commits

Write clear and descriptive commit messages.

### Recommended Format

```text
<type>: <description>
```

Examples:

```text
feat: add sprite animation system
fix: prevent duplicate texture loading
refactor: simplify scene management
docs: update getting started instructions
test: add renderer tests
perf: reduce texture allocation overhead
```

Keep commits focused on one logical change whenever practical.

Avoid commit messages such as:

```text
stuff
changes
final
final final
fixed
update
```

---

## Pull Requests

Before submitting a Pull Request, make sure:

- [ ] The project builds successfully.
- [ ] Existing functionality still works.
- [ ] Tests pass.
- [ ] New functionality has appropriate tests where applicable.
- [ ] Documentation has been updated if necessary.
- [ ] No unnecessary files or generated artifacts are included.
- [ ] The Pull Request contains only related changes.
- [ ] Commit messages are clear.
- [ ] The Pull Request description explains the change.

### Pull Request Description

A good Pull Request should explain:

```text
## What changed?

Brief description of the implementation.

## Why?

Explain the problem this change solves.

## How?

Describe the important implementation details.

## Testing

Explain how the change was tested.

## Screenshots / Demo

Include screenshots, GIFs, or videos when the change affects
visual or gameplay behavior.
```

---

## Bug Reports

When reporting a bug, provide enough information to reproduce it.

Include:

- SA2DGE version or commit.
- Operating system.
- Compiler/runtime version if relevant.
- Steps to reproduce.
- Expected behavior.
- Actual behavior.
- Error messages or logs.
- Minimal reproduction when possible.
- Screenshots or videos for visual problems.

### Example

```text
## Bug

Sprite disappears when the window is resized.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Start the example application.
2. Create a sprite.
3. Resize the window.
4. Observe the renderer.

## Expected Behavior

The sprite should remain visible.

## Actual Behavior

The sprite disappears after resizing.

## Environment

OS: Windows 11
SA2DGE: <commit/version>
```

---

## Feature Requests

Feature requests should explain the problem rather than only requesting a specific implementation.

Include:

- The problem you are trying to solve.
- Why the feature would be useful.
- Possible implementation approaches.
- Examples of how the API could be used.

For example:

```text
## Problem

Games currently have no built-in way to manage sprite animations.

## Proposed Solution

Introduce an animation component capable of managing
frames, frame duration, looping, and playback state.

## Example API

animation.play("run");
animation.pause();
animation.stop();
```

For large architectural changes, discuss the proposal before implementing it.

---

## Documentation

Documentation contributions are welcome.

You can contribute by improving:

- Installation instructions.
- API documentation.
- Tutorials.
- Examples.
- Architecture documentation.
- Comments explaining complex systems.
- Troubleshooting guides.

If a feature changes how users interact with SA2DGE, update the relevant documentation as part of the same Pull Request.

---

## Testing

Every contribution should be tested appropriately.

Depending on the change, testing may include:

- Unit tests.
- Integration tests.
- Example projects.
- Manual testing.
- Rendering verification.
- Performance testing.
- Platform-specific testing.

For engine systems, test both normal behavior and important edge cases.

Examples:

```text
Empty input
Invalid resource
Missing asset
Zero-sized object
Large number of entities
Window resizing
Repeated initialization
Repeated shutdown
```

---

## Performance Changes

If your contribution is intended to improve performance, provide evidence when possible.

Useful information includes:

- Benchmark results.
- Before/after measurements.
- Memory usage.
- Frame-time measurements.
- Number of objects tested.
- Hardware/environment used.

Avoid optimizing based only on assumptions.

---

## Dependencies

Avoid adding external dependencies unless they provide significant value.

Before adding a dependency, consider:

- Is it necessary?
- Can the functionality reasonably be implemented internally?
- Does it introduce platform-specific problems?
- What is its license?
- Is it actively maintained?
- What impact does it have on build size and complexity?

Discuss significant new dependencies before introducing them.

---

## Breaking Changes

Changes that modify or remove an existing public API should be treated carefully.

A Pull Request containing a breaking change should clearly explain:

1. What is changing.
2. Why the change is necessary.
3. What existing code will be affected.
4. How users can migrate.

Example:

```text
BREAKING CHANGE:

TextureManager::loadTexture() now returns a TextureHandle
instead of a raw Texture object.

Migration:

Old:
auto texture = loadTexture("player.png");

New:
auto texture = textureManager.load("player.png");
```

---

## Assets and Licensing

Only contribute assets that you have the right to distribute.

This includes:

- Textures.
- Sprites.
- Fonts.
- Audio.
- Models.
- Code from external projects.

Do not submit copyrighted assets without appropriate permission or licensing.

If an external asset is used, clearly document its license and source.

---

## Questions and Discussions

If you are unsure about an implementation, open an issue or discussion before making a large change.

Technical discussion is encouraged, especially around:

- Engine architecture.
- Rendering.
- Physics.
- Resource management.
- Performance.
- Public APIs.
- Platform support.

The goal is to build SA2DGE as a maintainable engine rather than simply adding features as quickly as possible.

---

## Final Notes

SA2DGE is an evolving project.

Not every contribution needs to be a major engine feature. Small improvements such as bug fixes, documentation, tests, examples, and tooling are valuable.

If you are contributing, focus on:

```text
Correctness
   ↓
Clarity
   ↓
Maintainability
   ↓
Performance
   ↓
Extensibility
```

Thank you for helping build SA2DGE! 🚀
